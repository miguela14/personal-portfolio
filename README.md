# Personal Portfolio

## Portfolio made with pure HTML & CSS

Short discription explaining the what, motivation, why, and how of my project:

- Deployed a live portfolio created for myself.
- My motivation was to create a personal portolio to display my work to future employers as well as potential collaborators.
- To give an insight on how clean my code can be as well as my all around projects.
- By creating code dealing with pure HTML as well as Css.
