# Personal Portfolio

## Portfolio made with pure HTML & CSS

Short discription explaining the what, motivation, why, and how of my project:

- Welcome to my portfolio website, where I have showcased my skills and accomplishments using HTML and CSS. This site reflects my unique style and showcases my projects, experiences, and talents in a visually appealing manner. With a clean and modern design, it allows visitors to navigate through various sections effortlessly, such as my about me page, my portfolio showcasing my best works, and a contact page to get in touch with me. Through the careful use of color schemes, typography, and responsive design, I have created an engaging platform that highlights my abilities and passion for web development. I invite you to explore my portfolio and get a glimpse into my journey and expertise in the world of front-end development.

- My motivation was to create a personal portolio to display my work to future employers as well as potential collaborators.

- By creating code dealing with pure HTML as well as Css.
